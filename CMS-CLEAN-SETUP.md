# Monica's Site - CLEAN CMS Setup

## ‚úÖ What Monica's Site Has (ONLY what it needs):

### 1. **The Website** 
- All the pages (Homepage, About, Services, Contact, Learning Center)
- All content marked with `data-cms` attributes for editing
- Beautiful, functional site ready for visitors

### 2. **Two API Endpoints** (in `/netlify/functions/`)
- `cms-content.ts` - Allows your portal to read/write content
- `contact-form.js` - Handles contact form submissions

### 3. **That's IT!**
- NO login pages on Monica's site
- NO user management on Monica's site  
- NO authentication on Monica's site
- Monica NEVER comes to her own site to edit

## üè† How It Actually Works:

```
1. Monica goes to ‚Üí ibuildcalm.com/portal (YOUR site)
2. She logs in with credentials YOU give her
3. She sees her site listed
4. She clicks to edit
5. YOUR portal talks to ‚Üí monica's-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/cms-content
6. Changes save to Monica's site
```

## üìù What YOU Need to Do in YOUR Portal:

### Add Monica's Site Configuration:
```javascript
{
  siteName: "Monica Leggett Coaching",
  siteUrl: "https://splendorous-medovik-027a50.netlify.app",
  apiEndpoint: "https://splendorous-medovik-027a50.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/cms-content",
  siteId: "monica-leggett"
}
```

### Add Monica as a User:
```javascript
{
  email: "monica@monicaleggett.com",
  password: "[something simple]",
  role: "client",
  sites: ["monica-leggett"]
}
```

## üéØ The Clean Setup:

**Monica's Site:**
- Just a website with API endpoints
- No login functionality
- No user database
- Clean and simple

**Your Portal (ibuildcalm.com):**
- Central login for all clients
- User management
- Connects to client site APIs
- You control everything

## ‚ú® Why This is Better:

1. **One login system** - Yours at ibuildcalm.com
2. **Central control** - You manage all clients in one place
3. **Client sites stay simple** - Just content and APIs
4. **No confusion** - Monica only knows about ONE login place
5. **Scalable** - Same pattern for every client

## üö´ What We Removed:

- ‚ùå `/portal` page on Monica's site
- ‚ùå `/cms-test` page 
- ‚ùå All auth functions (auth.ts, user-management.ts, etc.)
- ‚ùå Test user functions
- ‚ùå Anything related to logging in on Monica's site

## ‚úÖ Current Status:

Monica's site is now CLEAN and CORRECT:
- Live at: https://splendorous-medovik-027a50.netlify.app
- API endpoint ready at: /netlify/functions/cms-content
- Waiting for you to add it to your portal

---

**Bottom Line:** Monica's site is just a website with an API. Your portal does all the login/editing magic.
