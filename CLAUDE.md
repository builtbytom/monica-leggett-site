### 🚨 CRITICAL FOR NEXT SESSION: CMS INTEGRATION

**REMEMBER: Monica is older and non-technical. The CMS must be STUPID SIMPLE.**

#### When Adding ANY New Content:
1. **EVERY text element MUST have a `data-cms` attribute**
   ```html
   <h1 data-cms="unique-identifier">Editable Heading</h1>
   <p data-cms="unique-paragraph-id">Editable paragraph text</p>
   ```

2. **EVERY image MUST have a `data-cms-image` attribute**
   ```html
   <img data-cms-image="unique-image-id" src="/images/example.jpg" alt="...">
   ```

3. **CMS Portal Requirements for Monica:**
   - One-click editing (no code, no markdown)
   - Visual preview of changes
   - Big, clear "Save" button
   - Automatic image optimization

### 🔑 KEY DECISIONS MADE

1. **Learning Center vs Blog**: Monica calls her content hub "Learning Center" not blog. This is now the primary content area with her 8-step framework and resources.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

2. **Content is EVERYTHING**: This is a content-heavy site, not a brochure site
3. **Mobile/iPad Testing**: Monica might edit from iPad - must work perfectly
