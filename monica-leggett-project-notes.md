## üõ† Technical Stack Decision

### Why Astro Makes Sense Here
‚úÖ **Perfect for content sites** - Monica's is mostly static content  
‚úÖ **Blazing fast** - Better than her Wix site  
‚úÖ **Great SEO out of the box** - She needs to be found  
‚úÖ **Works with your CMS** - Can integrate with Tom's portal  
‚úÖ **Easy blog setup** - Built-in content collections  
‚úÖ **No client-side JS bloat** - Fast on mobile  

### Build Approach
```
Framework: Astro 4.x
Styling: Tailwind CSS
CMS: Tom's Custom Portal (already built)
Hosting: Netlify
Blog: Astro Content Collections
Forms: Netlify Forms
Analytics: Google Analytics 4
```

### Alternative Considered
- **Next.js** - Overkill for mostly static site
- **WordPress** - Monthly hosting fees, against Tom's model
- **Webflow** - Monthly fees, less control
